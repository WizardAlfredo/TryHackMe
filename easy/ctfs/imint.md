# Searchlight - IMINT

## Welcome to the Searchlight IMINT room

This room will introduce you to several topics within IMINT, among them:

1. Getting into the right mindset and how to be analytical
2. Visually extracting key data points from an image or video
3. Applying different tools to assist you in geolocation and answering context questions

## First Challenge

#### Let's introduce you to your first tool - your eyes

Before we can apply a tool or a methodology for finding the location of an image,
we should use our eyes to scan the image for important information.
Extracting key data points from the image will allow you to apply the right tool,
craft a good Google search or identify which part of the world the image might
have been taken in.

There are 5 elements of IMINT that you should consider when looking at an image,
according to Geoint expert Benjamin Strick:

- Context
- Foreground
- Background
- Map markings
- Trial and error

A geolocation challenge like this lacks one important factor,
which is the context or the source of the image. In real-world cases,
you usually have a context in which the image was produced or shared,
usually called context clues.
Most of these challenges will not have context clues but you may find clues
in the titles and descriptions, or if you're stuck you can use the hint function.

#### Here are some questions you should ask yourself

- Are there any obvious data in the image that reveals the location,
like a street name or storefront signs?

- Can you determine the country or region of the image by,
for instance, which side of the road they drive on,
language or architectural characteristics that may reveal a country or
continent/region?

- Do you recognize road sign styles, nature and environmental characteristics,
or popular motor vehicle brands or vehicle types?

- What is the quality of any visible infrastructure like?
Is the road paved or do you see gravel roads?

- Do you see any unique landmarks, buildings, bridges,
statues or mountains that can help you geolocate the image?

## Just Google It

Let me introduce you to your first tool, Google!
If you see anything in the image that can be extracted into a keyword, phrase,
a company name, telephone number or any other question you may have as a result
of scanning the image up and down: GOOGLE IT!

[Here](https://osintcurio.us/2019/12/20/google-dorks/)
is a short introduction to what we call 'dorking',
the art of using Google search queries to have Google return specific types of data.
The next challenges will require you to do some basic Googling in order to
answer the questions.
You can also practice dorking by joining the Google Dorking room.

When geolocating a picture finding the exact location is key,
but we may need to answer other questions about the location or the image as well,
usually referred to as context questions.

The next few challenges will ask multiple questions that you need to answer
based on the information you extract from the image.

## Reverse Image Search

One of the methods for geolocating an image is to do an image reverse search.
This means that we are searching for the image itself online,
and if the image has been indexed by search engines we may find the exact image
or we can do a visual search or crop search to help us find similar images.

 Aric Toler from Bellingcat has written a fantastic guide on reversing images,
 please read it [here](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/12/26/guide-to-using-reverse-image-search-for-investigations/).
 OSINT Curious also has a [write-up](https://osintcurio.us/2020/04/12/tips-and-tricks-on-reverse-image-searches/)
 on the topic that you should look through before attempting this challenge.

## A justice for all

I highly recommend watching this Ted talk by Amy Herman on visual intelligence
[A lesson on looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHmjs2270A)
if you want a unique view on how you perceive visual data.

## The view from my hotel

Geolocating videos aren't much different from geolocating images.
A video is just a string of images, usually played at 24 frames(or images) per second.
In other words, a video will hold a whole lot more images that can be analyzed,
reversed and scrutinized by you.

Here's a good [writeup](https://nixintel.info/osint-tools/using-ffmpeg-to-grab-stills-and-audio-for-osint/)
by Nixintel on a tool called FFmpeg, which will help you extract the key images
from the video that you may need to solve this challenge.
